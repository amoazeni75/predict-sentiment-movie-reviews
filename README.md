<h1>Predict Sentiment From Movie Reviews</h1>
<p>
  Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing problem where text is understood and the
underlying intent is predicted. In this project we will discover how we can predict the sentiment
of movie reviews as either positive or negative in Python using the Keras deep learning library
   </p>
<p>what we will discover in this project are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>About the IMDB sentiment analysis problem for natural language processing and how to
load it in Keras.</li>
  <li>How to use word embedding in Keras for natural language problems.</li>
  <li>How to develop and evaluate a Multilayer Perceptron model for the IMDB problem.</li>
  <li>How to develop a one-dimensional convolutional neural network model for the IMDB
    problem.</li>
 </ul>
