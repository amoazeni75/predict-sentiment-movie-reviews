<h1>Predict Sentiment From Movie Reviews</h1>
<p>
  Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing problem where text is understood and the
underlying intent is predicted. In this project we will discover how we can predict the sentiment
of movie reviews as either positive or negative in Python using the Keras deep learning library
   </p>
<p>what we will discover in this project are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>About the IMDB sentiment analysis problem for natural language processing and how to
load it in Keras.</li>
  <li>How to use word embedding in Keras for natural language problems.</li>
  <li>How to develop and evaluate a Multilayer Perceptron model for the IMDB problem.</li>
  <li>How to develop a one-dimensional convolutional neural network model for the IMDB
    problem.</li>
 </ul>
<p>The Large Movie Review Dataset (often referred to as the IMDB dataset)
contains 25,000 highly-polar movie reviews (good or bad) for training and the same amount
again for testing. The problem is to determine whether a given moving review has a positive or
negative sentiment.</p>

<p>The words have been replaced by integers that indicate the absolute popularity of the
word in the dataset. The sentences in each review are therefore comprised of a sequence of
integers.</p>
